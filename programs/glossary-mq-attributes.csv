Attribute	Attribute description
Protein	Uniprot accession
Peptide	The amino acid sequence of the peptide
Length	Peptide sequence length (number of amino acid residues)
Position	The peptide position in the protein sequence.  The type of occurrence, exact or inexact, is indicated
Source of peptide identification	The source of peptide identification, which may be DDA sample, SRM data or in-silico digestion
Intensity	Summed up eXtracted Ion Current (XIC) of all isotopic clusters associated with the identified amino acid sequence.  For peptides with no identification data this and the following columns have "-"
Intensity quartile	Peptide intensity rank with respect to the intensity of other peptides from the same protein (based on DDA user data)
Samples with valid intensity value	The reported number of experimental samples with peptide quantification
MQ MS/MS count	The number of sequencing events for the peptide sequence (if an evidence file is provided). This number considers the non-modified and modified sequences of the same peptide
MQ Unique (Groups)	If "yes", peptide is unique to a single protein group in the protein Groups file.  If "no", peptide is not unique
MQ Unique (Proteins)	If "yes", peptide is unique to a single protein sequence in the fasta file.  If "no", peptide is not unique
Occurrences in proteome sequences	The number of occurrences of the peptide in sequences of the reference proteome
IDs of proteome sequences	At most 5 IDs of sequences in the reference proteome where the peptide occurs
Occurrences in gene sequences	The number of occurrences of the peptide in distinct genes of the reference proteome identified by a GN label
IDs of gene sequences	At most 5 IDs of genes in the reference proteome where the peptide occurs
PTMs	A list of post-translational modifications including the peptide
PTM evidences	The source of post-translational modifications (experimental, non-experimental)
Occurrences in contaminant sequences	The number of occurrences of the peptide in contaminant sequences.	
Methionines	The number of methionine residues in the peptide sequence
Methionine positions	The position of methionine residues in the peptide sequence
Missing cleavages	The number of missing trypsin cleavages
Missing cleavage positions	The position of the missing cleavage site in the peptide sequence
Retention time	The experimental retention time in the elution profile of the precursor ion in minutes (if an evidence file is provided)
Hydrophobicity index	A measure of relative hydrophobicity evaluated based only on amino acid composition
Theoretical retention time (wrt samples)	A theoretical retention time for the peptide based on the hydrophobicity index and on experimental retention times of samples
Theoretical retention time (wrt iRT)	A theoretical retention time for the peptide based on the hydrophobicity index and on experimental retention times of iRTs
Previous aa	The amino acid that precedes the first amino acid of the peptide
First aa	The first amino acid of the peptide
Last aa	The last amino acid of the peptide
Next aa	The amino acid that follows the last amino acid of the peptide
Instruments reported in PeptideAtlas experiments	A list of instrument names with which the peptide was detected as reported by PeptideAtlas (for peptides in sample or SRM Atlas)
