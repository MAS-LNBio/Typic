mergerow{4}Q.i. quartile	1	The peptide quantitative value in Q1 is the least intense compared to others peptides from same protein in DDA data set	red
	2	The peptide quantitative value in Q2 is more intense than Q1 compared to other peptides from the same protein in DDA data set	red
	3	The peptide quantitative value in Q3 is more intense than Q2 compared to others peptides from the same protein in DDA data set	green
	4	The peptide quantitative value in Q4 is the most intense compared to others peptides from the same protein in DDA data set	green
Occurrences in proteome sequences	number	The number of occurrences of the peptide in sequences of the reference proteome	red if greater than 1, green otherwise
mergerow{2}PTMs	type and position of PTMs	Post-translational modifications including the residue position in the protein	red 
	-	There are no PTMs reported in Uniprot for the peptide	green
mergerow{2}PTM evidences	non-experimental evidence	Predicted PTM (Uniprot Database)	mergerow{2}green if none, red otherwise
	experimental evidence	Evidence of experimental PTMs (Uniprot Database)	
Methionines	number	The number of methionine residues in the peptide sequence	green if zero or red if greater than zero
missing cleavages	number	The number of missed enzymatic cleavages	green if zero or red if greater than zero
first aa	amino acid	If the enzyme is trypsin, the amino acid in the first position of the peptide sequence. D or E in this position indicate a probable missed enzymatic cleavage	red if D or E, green otherwise
next aa	amino acid	If the enzyme is trypsin, the amino acid that follows the last amino acid of the peptide. D or E in this position indicate a probable missed enzymatic cleavage	red if D or E, green otherwise
