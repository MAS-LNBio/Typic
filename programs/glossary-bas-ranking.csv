Attribute	Reported options	Description	Ranking criteria
Protein		Uniprot accession
Peptide		The amino acid sequence of the peptide
Length		Peptide length
mergerow{2}Source	SRM Atlas	Peptide identified in SRM Atlas	yellow
	in-silico digestion	Peptide identified by in-silico digestion	red
Occurrences in proteome sequences	number	The number of occurrences of the peptide in sequences of the reference proteome	red if greater than 1, green otherwise
mergerow{2}PTMs	type and position of PTMs	Post-translational modifications including the residue position in the protein	red 
	-	There are no PTMs reported in Uniprot for the peptide	green
mergerow{2}PTM evidences	non-experimental evidence	Predicted PTM (Uniprot Database)	mergerow{2}green if none, red otherwise
	experimental evidence	Evidence of experimental PTMs (Uniprot Database)	
Methionines	number	The number of methionine residues in the peptide sequence	green if zero or red if greater than zero
missing cleavages	number	The number of missed enzymatic cleavages	green if zero or red if greater than zero
first aa	amino acid	If the enzyme is trypsin, the amino acid in the first position of the peptide sequence. D or E in this position indicate a probable missed enzymatic cleavage	red if D or E, green otherwise
next aa	amino acid	If the enzyme is trypsin, the amino acid that follows the last amino acid of the peptide. D or E in this position indicate a probable missed enzymatic cleavage	red if D or E, green otherwise
