Web interface for Typic 
This file is part of Typic version 6.


This folder contains a cgi web interface to Typic.

To run Typic through the web, a webserver (as Apache) must be set to
execute *.cgi files and to grant access to files with names *.css and
*.js.  All the rest may be denied.

There are three major components:

1) the frontend typic.cgi, that will be executed as the webserver
user.

2) typic-daemon, that dispatches typic.pl on data received by typic.cgi
and should be executed as a regular user.

3) typic-dwn.cgi, that uploads finished jobs to users.

Write permission must be granted for the webserver group to access the
files typic.log and typic.jobs, so that both typic.cgi and
typic-daemon may write to them.

typic-daemon uses sendmail to send emails. It must be properly set.

typic.cgi, typic-daemon and typic-dwn.cgi depend on the following Perl
packages:

CGI
Encode
Fcntl
POSIX 
Time::Local
Archive::Zip 

Selection options in the web interface are configured through files 

slct-contaminants.txt
slct-irts.txt
slct-proteomes.txt
slct-srms.txt

that have, in each row, a file name, a space and the selection tag.

The files in the "program" folder must also be copied to the same
folder having the files in the folder "web-interface".

Some variables in the first lines of typic.cgi, typic-daemon and
typic-dwn.cgi may be of interest, particularly $ecof and $datad in
typic.cgi.

The policies for user data clean-up and downloaded data update have to
be defined by the site owner and taken care by an external mechanism,
for instance, by a bash script triggered by cron.
