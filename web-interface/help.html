<p>
Typic is a program that collects data from multiple sources and
produces a ranking of the peptides of a protein to support the
selection of proteotypic peptides.  Proteotypic peptides are those
peptides that uniquely identify a protein and are consistently
identified when a sample with a protein mixture is analyzed in an
LC/MS experiment.

Typic manual</a> has a description of option for the program.
