# typic
A tool to rank proteotypic peptides for targeted proteomics

Typic is a program that collects data from multiple sources and
produces a ranking of the peptides of a protein to support the
selection of proteotypic peptides.

Typic is written in Perl as the command line application typic.pl.
The Tk graphical interface (typic-tk.pl, tkexcmd.pm, tkexwin.pm) and
the cgi web interface (typic.cgi, typic-daemon, typic-dwn.cgi) both
dispatch typic.pl.
